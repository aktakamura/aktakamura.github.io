      <p>
        Raw ideas live here. Honest discomforts. Everything that refuses to fit
        into form.

        Gratitude is, above all, an act of letting go and letting things follow

        <p>Organizing your thoughts takes time.</p>
        <p>And it’s exhausting.</p>

        <p>
          But trying to remember everything<br />
          using only your head<br />
          is much worse.
        </p>

        <p>
          No one will tell you what you need to remember.<br />
          At work, maybe a micromanaging boss will.<br />
          But in your life, no one will.
        </p>

        <p>
          One thought at a time.<br />
          One less microtask occupying your mind.
        </p>

        <p>
          And when you least expect it,<br />
          a flow of deliveries,<br />
          a whirlwind of actions.
        </p>

        <p>
          You’ll realize your life was already moving.<br />
          It was your mind that was stuck.
        </p>

        <p>
          And that peace<br />
          is true freedom.

        <p>I had a meeting scheduled.</p>

        <p>
          One of those where I would explain, for the umpteenth time, a
          dashboard that was supposedly finished. With all dataflows validated.
        </p>

        <p class="thought-emphasis">Suddenly, it was canceled.</p>

        <p>And the relief came like lightning.</p>

        <p>The day felt brighter. A little cooler. Lighter.</p>

        <p class="thought-emphasis">Energy. Silence. Peace.</p>

        <p>
          It made me think that maybe the problem is not the meeting. Not the
          people. Not the job.
        </p>

        <p>
          Maybe it is the role I play in it. Maybe it is being “the BI guy”.
        </p>

        <p>
          Translating the obvious. Sustaining a ritual that no longer moves me.
          That no longer gives me meaning.
        </p>

        <p class="thought-emphasis">I do not have answers today.</p>

        <p>
          Only the clear feeling that something emptied. And that says more
          about me than about the job.
